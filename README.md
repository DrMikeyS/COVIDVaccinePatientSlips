# Important: Tool No Longer Being Updated

This tool was developed in January 2021 in response to an urgent need to support the safe running of local vaccination sites. As vaccination is now becoming part of normal practice, it is important that tools like this are fully supported by a responsive organisation.

Therefore, **it is not advised this tool is used in clinical practice unless it is being supported by an appropriately experienced organisation who can maintin the code**.

Historical versions of the tool will remain on GitHub for the purpose of allowing organisations to take and continue development of the tool with appropriate support mechanisms.
