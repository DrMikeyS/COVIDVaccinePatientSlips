# COVID Vaccine QR Generator
A free tool that allows you to convert a CSV list of patients into a printable pack of patient slips to make using Pinnacle a breeze.

## Why Use It?
Looking up patients in Outcomes4Health takes so long many vaccine sites are pre-registering patients (which takes hours). Part of the issue is transcribing NHS number and DOB (in the very specific format it demands). This takes your list of patients for a vaccine session and for each patient generates a slip with a QR code for their DOB and NHS Number so they can be entered into Outcomes4Health rapidly using barcode scanners that vaccine sites have available.
