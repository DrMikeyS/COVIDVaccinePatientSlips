## Why Use It?
Looking up patients in Outcomes4Health takes so long many vaccine sites are pre-registering patients (which takes hours). Part of the issue is transcribing NHS number and DOB (in the very specific format it demands). This takes your list of patients for a vaccine session and for each patient generates a slip with a QR code for their DOB and NHS Number so they can be entered into Outcomes4Health rapidly using barcode scanners that vaccine sites have available. 

## New Features
The project is constantly evolving to the needs of vaccine clinics. If you want to try and test the latest features, checkout the [development version](https://github.com/DrMikeyS/COVIDVaccinePatientSlips/tree/dev).

## Video Demo
[See this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA-5K7eZB7Q) for how the process works in detail. 

##  Testing
There is a dummy patient csv file included in the ZIP file to test the system before using real patient data.

## Instructions For Use

 - [Download](https://github.com/DrMikeyS/COVIDVaccinePatientSlips/releases) the file package
 - Extract the zip file (right click on the file->Extract All). This step is **very important** as it will not run if opened by double clicking on the zip file.
 - Open "index.html" in Chrome
 - Follow the on-screen instructions
 - Print out the patient slips
 - Use barcode scanners to scan patient details into Outcomes4Health

## IG and Security
No data is transferred anywhere when using this tool, all the process is done in your web browser. The tool uses some open source libraries to work. Using the tool is entirely at your own risk.
